# INTRODUCION
This code does a deep analysis of comment data using Natural Language Processing (NLP), looking at how feelings change over time. It starts with loading data and using advanced models to understand sentiments, and then shows the results in dynamic visuals.
It was decided to classify the comments into 3 categories:
- POSITIVE COMMENTS.
- NEUTRAL COMMENTS.
- NEGATIVE COMMENTS.

## USED LIST CONCEPTS:
### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - Downloading data from Google Drive.
   - Using Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Implementation of a sentiment analysis model using Hugging Face Transformers.
   - Classifying comments into positive, neutral, and negative categories.

### 3. Regular Expressions:
   - Using regular expressions to extract numerical information from comments.

### 4. Temporal Grouping:
   - Applying temporal grouping techniques to analyze the evolution of sentiments over time.

### 5. Data Visualization:
   - Utilizing libraries such as Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for effective data visualization, including static and dynamic charts.

### 6. Date Transformation:
   - Conversion and manipulation of date formats to facilitate temporal analysis.

### 7. NLP Text Processing:
   - Utilizing pre-trained models for sentiment analysis, highlighting the BERT model in this case.
